## Elevator pitch

__The data that I have illustrated in the scatterplot and table bellow explores the relationship between the highway miles per gallon and the engine displacement which is the amount of air moved by the car's cylinders wether that be in or out of it. I found a trend where, the lower the engine displacement, the higher the miles per gallon were on the highways. Towards the end of the chart, I noticed a few outliers with some of the higher displacement engines having I higher value of miles per gallon than their counterparts. Something like this may suggest that the chart may continue in an upward trend._

```{python}
mpg = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byuidatascience/data4python4ds/master/data-raw/mpg/mpg.csv")

```

_I believe I have everything running smoothly. I uninstalled python 3.12 and reinstalled python 3.11.7 to be safe. I have no other questions at this time._


## Manufacturer Scatterplot


_It took a lot of hopping from source to source in the reading but it came to me slowly but surely. Below includes the scatterplot created in plotly which replicates the scatterplot in textbook 3.2.2._


```{python}
#| label: Q2 chart
#| code-summary: plot example
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplot"
#| fig-align: center

chart = px.scatter(mpg.head(200),
    x="displ", 
    y="hwy",
    color="manufacturer"
)
chart.show()
```


## Manufacturer Markdown Table


_The markdown table took quite a while for me to figure out how to render it. I needed to install tabulate to have my code generate the table. My syntax initially to install it was incorrect. after finding the correct synax I was able to move forward. The markdown table that was generated featured five of the same audi model a4 from different years. I found that the audi's that were from earlier years like 1999 had a lower highway miles per gallon than their counterparts from 2008. This may suggest that as time has moved forward the engine displacement has gotten lower and more efficient._


```{python}
#| label: Q3 table
#| code-summary: table
#| tbl-cap: "table"
#| tbl-cap-location: top
print(mpg
  .head(5)
  .filter(["manufacturer", "model","year", "hwy"])
  .to_markdown(index=False))

```
